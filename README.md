<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

</p>

DediManager is a Linux based application written in java and developed to manage, secure, and automate your Minecraft Server Network. A big part of every server owners goal is to grow and gain and more loyal and engaged playerbase. When upgrading and expanding your servers playerbase you have plenty of expenses already coming your way, the idea of potentially adding more expenses before increasing revenue can be intimidating. A large majority of server owners are running on shared hosts with Multicraft or Pterodactyl setup. The convenience of these services are very appealing and usually the best option for starting off. However once your server is bringing in revenue, you need to start treating it like a business by planning on expanding to take your server to the next level.

<!--Introduction-->

<p align="center">

  </a>
</p>

Performance & connectivity is one of the most crucial parts to your server success, if either are suffering you are potentially sending players to find a server without those issues present. Having your TPS at 20.00 and fast connection speeds will guarantee more player satisfaction and can also be turned into a strong marketing tactic as many servers struggle with this issue. This is where server owners look to upgrade to a virtual private server or a dedicated server to give them more bang for their buck, mainly will pay a system admin a 1 time fee often ranging of above $30 USD to ultimately just type a few commands. This is where the idea for DediManager started, the idea of creating a program that was programmed to create and manager custom minecraft network's running on any operating system for a small 1 time fee.

DediManager comes with many useful and important tools to ensure your server is running at it's highest performance some examples of features are:
 * Extensive User Interface
 * File Editing & Management
 * Multiple Users
 * Scheduled Backups
 * Security & Network Protection
 * and many more!

</p>

DediManager's objective is to simplify the transition and startup of Minecraft server networks running on any operating system. It was developed to be a "plug n play" application that requires 0 knowledge on dedicated servers. It is also a great tool to transfer already existing networks and servers to different systems, making anybody with FTP access able to transfer server data. Editing files such as 'server.properties' or 'spigot.yml' becomes very tedious and can get messy quickly when you have many servers running on a system. The File Editing & Management system makes this process simple, print out differences, change values, and reset any minecraft server file.
